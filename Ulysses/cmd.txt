Cyber Defenders (Ulysses )
A Linux server was possibly compromised and a forensic analysis is required in order to understand what really happened. Hard disk dumps and memory snapshots of the machine are provided in order to solve the challenge.
                            ----------------------------------
PREPA
We're given a zip file which contains a LinuxDebian profile to use in volatility 
$ cp Debian5_26.zip /volatility/volatility/plugins/overlays/linux

We are also given and sda.img file to investigate, to extract it i used
$ mkdir sda_mount
$ mount victoria-v8.sda1.img sda_mount/ 
                      --------------------------------------------------

Q1/. The attacker was performing a Brute Force attack. What account triggered the alert?
$ sudo cat /sda_mount/var/log/auth.log

Q2/. How many were failed attempts there?
$ sudo cat /sda_mount/var/log/auth.log | grep -i "failed" | wc
(wc gives us an extra field for the root so the answer was 32 not 33)

Q3/. What kind of system runs on the targeted server?
$ cat /sda_mount/etc/issue.net

Q4/. What is the victim's IP address?
$ python2 vol.py -f victoria-v8.memdump.img --profile=LinuxDebian5_26x86 linux_netstat > linux_netstat.txt

Q5/. What are the attacker's two IP addresses? Format: comma-separated in ascending order
$ cat linux_netstat.txt

Q6/. What is the "nc" service PID number that was running on the server?
$ python2 vol.py -f victoria-v8.memdump.img --profile=LinuxDebian5_26x86 linux_pslist > linux_pslist.txt

Q7/. What service was exploited to gain access to the system? (one word)
$ python2 vol.py -f victoria-v8.memdump.img --profile=LinuxDebian5_26x86 linux_psaux > linux_psaux.txt

Q8/. What is the CVE number of exploited vulnerability? 
CVE-2010-4344

Q9/. During this attack, the attacker downloaded two files to the server. Provide the name of the compressed file.
$ cd /sda_mount/tmp && ls

Q10/. Two ports were involved in the process of data exfiltration. Provide the port number of the highest one.
$ cat linux_netstat.txt

Q11/. Which port did the attacker try to block on the firewall?
$ cd /sda_mount/tmp
$ sudo tar -xvf rk.tar && cd rk
$ cat vars.sh
